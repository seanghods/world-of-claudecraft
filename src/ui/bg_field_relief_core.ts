// Pure relief painter for the Ravenrift battleground field's two map
// backgrounds: the M-key field plan (battleground_map_painter) and the cached
// minimap raster (minimap_painter). Host-agnostic (no DOM, no canvas, no i18n):
// it writes straight into the flat RGBA buffer an `ImageData` exposes, which is
// the same contract map_terrain.ts holds for the overworld map, so the heavy
// per-pixel work is unit-testable in Node and the two surfaces cannot drift.
//
// Heights come from `bgFieldHeightLocal`, the ONE surface the sim, the server
// and the renderer all sample, so a shaded ridge on the map is a ridge a
// fighter really has to climb. The colours are a hypsometric ramp over the
// authored field (the flat walled play field, then the forested backdrop
// slopes outside the ramparts, which are out of play) plus a west-to-east
// hillshade, which is what makes the backdrop rim read at map scale.
//
// The ramp is a hardcoded terrain palette, exactly as map_terrain.ts hardcodes
// the overworld biome colours: it is sampled terrain, not HUD chrome, and a
// design token cannot be read from a raw pixel buffer anyway. Every HUD-chrome
// colour drawn OVER this stays a token in the calling painter.
